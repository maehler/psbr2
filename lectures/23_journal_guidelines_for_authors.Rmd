# From exploration to publication

The way from plotting your first figure related to a certain dataset to a figure ready for publication is long.

I will show you some snapshots of the process of making a figure for the paper titled [A single gene underlies the dynamic evolution of poplar sex determination](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41477-020-0672-9).

The basic idea was that I would map reads from sRNA to a region in the genome of *Populus tremula* in order to support the hypothesis that this region produced sRNAs that in turn silenced a gene further upstream which results in sex-determination in these trees.

I started out with this.

In the end, this is what made it into the paper.

# Let's look at some guidelines

We'll look at the author guidelines for a couple different journals to see what they say about

- Figure formatting
- Statistical analyses
- Data sharing
- Code sharing

## Guidelines

- [New Phytologist](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/journal/14698137/about/author-guidelines)
- [eLife](https://reviewer.elifesciences.org/author-guide/full)
- [PLOS ONE](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines)
- [F1000 Research](https://f1000research.com/for-authors/article-guidelines/research-articles)

# Fully reproducible articles

The publisher eLife has made an effort to allow for researchers to publish fully reproducible articles.

.https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.2837center[
![:scale 65%, eLife Executable Research Articles](https://iiif.elifesciences.org/journal-cms/labs-post-preview%2F2020-08%2Fimage2.jpg/full/1172,/0/default.webp)
]

So far there are only a few articles of this kind published, but I hope (and think) that this will be an integral part of publishing in the future.

???

Even though this platform was developed by eLife and Stencila, they made it open-source and available for other publishers to use.

Let's look at an example paper using this system: https://elifesciences.org/articles/30274/executable

# Image editing

.pull-left[
More and more journals require authors to submit raw images of gels and such.

```{r, echo = FALSE}

  "One in 25 papers contains inappropriately duplicated images, study finds",
  "Elisabeth Bik, a microbiologist at Stanford, has for years been a behind-the-scenes force in scientific integrity, anonymously submitting reports on plagiarism and image duplication to journal editors. Now, she’s ready to come out of the shadows.",

# Conclusions

- Reproducibility is becoming of greater and greater concern, and more and more journals are becoming conscious about this.
- Carefully read the author guidelines for the journal you want to submit your manuscript to.
- Think about things like data sharing and transparent analyses already at the start of the project.
