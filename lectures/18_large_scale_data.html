&gt; "All science is either physics or stamp collecting."
&gt; .source[— Ernest Rutherford, 1871-1937]

???

Ernest Rutherford was a physicist from New Zealand, and with this he implied, toungue-in-cheek i presume, that all sciences except for physics just spend time collecting observations, and not actually inferring something from them.
I would like to say that this has changed, at least in biology.
You could argue that has a past full of "stamp collecting", for example like the systematics work by Linnaeus.
It is mostly about collecting species and putting them in bins.
Nowadays, we are using our observations to infer molecular mechanisms, be it the senescence of an aspen tree, or the progression of a cancer tumor.

# Large-scale data vs big data

[Wikipedia says](https://wikipedia.org/Big_data):

&gt; Big data is a field that treats ways to analyze, systematically extract information from, or otherwise deal with data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software.

???

You have probably heard the term "Big Data" before, but how does that relate to what we are doing?
Are we working with big data?

There are many different definitions of big data out there, and I will not really go into which is more correct.
The main point is that big data doesn't really translate into how many values you have in your dataset.
It is more the nature of your dataset, and the ability to use traditional methods to analyse them.
This does however often correlate with the size of the datasets, but not necessarily.

For example, we could collect temperature measurements every single minute for ten years.
This would result in `\(5.2596\times 10^{6}\)` data points.
Would you consider this to be big data?
If we only consider the number of data points, you might consider it being big data.
On the other hand, if we would consider other aspects of this data, it might not be so big.
For example, we could easily analyse these data with traditional tools, like regression models.
The size of the data on disk or in memory is tiny if you consider what computers today are capable of.
Also, this is a simple dataset in that there is only a single dimension to it.
You could say that it is relatively easy to get a computer to "understand" this data.

Let's say that we are working with something else, like satellite images.
Propose that we have a satellite that takes images of a glacier over the course of 10 years, where it takes one picture every week.
This is "only" 520 images.
Can this be considered big data?
A human could relatively easily skim the images and see how the glacier shrinks and grows over time.
Then consider what these images are composed of: potentially millions of pixels.
This is what the computer sees.
In order to process these images and transform them from data to information, a significant amount of work is needed.
You have to train some kind of classifier to determine what is land and what is glacier.
Can it handle if the ice gets dirty from sand and rocks?
Does it still classify it as a glacier?
And then it has to calculate the area of the glacier, and perhaps also weigh in other factors, such as weather.
Can this be considered big data?

# Dimensionality

Something that is often talked about when it comes to biological data is **dimensionality**.
Simply put, this is how many variables you have in your dataset.

.center[
&lt;img src="./figures/large_scale_data_how_many_dimensions-1.png" width="432" /&gt;
]

???

How many dimensions are we looking at here?

If you have two variables, you can accurately represent each observation in a two-dimensional space.
If you have three variables, you can accurately represent each observation in a three-dimensional space.
What about four variables?
Or six?
Or 30,000?

Anything more than three is often difficult to visualise in a meaningful way.

Now this has really exploded, so we need 1331 observations in order to cover this space.

# The curse of dimensionality

As we've seen, the size of the space increases exponentially with the number of dimensions.

The problem isn't so much that we have a lot of variables.
The problem is the number of observations we need to adequately cover this search space.
The actual number of observations that are needed depends on the resolution that we need.
If we are happy with just observing the extremes of the parameter space, that is to say two observations per variable, then we would need much fewer observations.
For 10 variables, this still means that we need a minimum of 1024 observations, which can be a lot if you are working with trees, for example.
Conversely, if we need higher resolution, then we would need even more observations.

Note here that I said that we need at least this many observations.
Likely we will need a lot more since the minimum number assumes that each observation represents a point in the search space that we haven't explored already.

This begs the question whether the whole search space is interesting.

---

# Do we need to cover the whole space?

Probably not.
There are likely large parts of the search space that we would never reach, regardless of how much data we collect.
This, of course, depends on the problem at hand.

`\(2^{784}\)` possible configurations.

This is a classic dataset of hand-written digits that is used in machine learning.
These are 28 by 28 pixel images, so 784 pixels in total, which is then the same as 784 dimensions.
I have simplified this a bit by converting it from a grayscale to strict black and white.
In other words, the pixels can only take one out of two values: white or black.
From the earlier slide we can then conclude that the number of possible configurations here is 2^784.

???

These are nine random set of pixels from this search space, and this is how most of this search space will look.
The number of possible configurations that will be possible is just a small piece of the possible search space, and this is, in this case, decided by pen strokes.
There is some variability in there, but you will hopefully never find someone who writes the number five like this.

# Packages for dealing with large datasets

Oftentimes, large datasets are accompanied by pretty specific data analysis.
Therefore, there are a whole plethora of packages in R for dealing with different types of large datasets.

Here I will present a couple of examples.

---

# What if your type of data is not presented?

&lt;iframe src="https://bioconductor.org" width="432" height="400px" data-external="1"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

???

Bioconductor is usually the first place to go to in order to find a package for whatever you are trying to do.

Note that the packages that I will go through next is not meant as a tutorial for each of these packages, but rather a quick overview of what is possible.

And also, important for all of these functions, or actually anything that you do in R: READ THE DOCUMENTATION!
There might be default arguments that don't exactly fit well with your data.
Best case scenario, you get an error.
Worst case scenario, your data is misrepresented, either that it is malformed, or you might miss out on some data.

A caveat with DESeq2 is that the sample table does not accept tibbles, only ordinary data frames, so you have to wrap your tibble in `as.data.frame`.

I told you at one point that whatever you can do with data frames, you can also do with tibbles.
So it turns out that was not 100% true.
If you'd like to, I could break down why tibbles don't work in this particular case.

bam
```

???

This example is taken from the Rsamtools vignette.

Let's walk through this, line by line.

1. Load the library
3. Define what sequences we want to extract from the BAM file. This says to extract alignments against sequence `seq1` from bases 1000 to 2000, and alignments to the sequence `seq2` from 100-1000, and 1000-2000.
4. `what` defines what fields we want to retrieve from the BAM file. For more information about this, we can go to the BAM file specification.
5. `param` will then be the paramters which we will use for reading the BAM file. We give this the `which` — the sequences we want to retrieve — and the `what` — what fields to retrieve.
7. Get the filename of the example file from the Rsamtools package.
8. Read the BAM file.
10. The resulting R object.

These functions are great if we don't have to see the whole dataset in order to start the processing.
This is definitely always the case, but it can be good to be able to identify such cases.

This is a little bit more advanced in that you would have to construct a callback function, so I'm mostly mentioning this for you to know that it exists.

This function works similar to the functions in readr, but it can be quite a bit faster.
By default this returns a `data.table` object, but this can easily be converted to a tibble if we would like to.

I should note that I haven't used this much at all since I mostly find the readr functions to be fast enough for my needs.

Don't start to worry about memory prematurely, only do that once it starts to actually become a problem, i.e. your computer runs out of memory.
]
]

???

Now it's starting to become quite advanced, and I will not go into how this actually works.
The take-home message here is that this can be used for reading objects that don't fit in memory.
It can solve this by storing the data structure on disk, and then pointing to specific bits of these files whenever they are needed.

The downside with this package is that it only deals with matrices, meaning that all columns must be of the same data type.

If you are using a system that is shared among many users, then there are usually safeguards in place so that you don't consume the memory of all users.
If that is not the case, then tread carefully and preferably err on the side of caution.
