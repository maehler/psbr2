# What is RStudio? { data-transition="slide-in fade-out" }

- Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
- Basically an advanced text editor that knows
  - The languague you are writing in
  - Can run the code that you write, interactively
  - Can display any plots that you generate
  - Can display help for any functions in the language
  - And much, much more

# What is RStudio? { data-transition="fade" }

```{r}
tags$figure(
  tags$img(src = base64_img(here("img/rstudio_screenshot.png"))),
  tags$figcaption("Screenshot of my RStudio window when writing this slide")
)
```


# What is RStudio? { data-transition="fade-in slide-out" }

- Open source
- Free as in free speech, not as in free beer
  - Free version more than enough for our needs though
- RStudio doesn't bundle R itself, this has to be installed separately
