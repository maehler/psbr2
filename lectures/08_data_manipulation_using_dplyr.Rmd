# What is data manipulation?

- Filtering
- Creating new variables
- Merging datasets
- Summarising datasets

---

# dplyr

> dplyr is a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges

Just as ggplot2, dplyr is part of the [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

or

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("dplyr")
```

followed by

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
```

or

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library("dplyr")
```

# dplyr verbs

dplyr works exclusively on data frames, or tibbles, of which we have seen examples of already.

These are some of the most commonly used verbs in dplyr:

- `filter`: Select subsets of rows based on values
- `select`: Select subsets of columns (variables) based on name
- `mutate`: Create new variables based on existing columns
- `summarise`: Reduce multiple rows into a single value
- `arrange`: Change the ordering of the rows

---

# The `nycflights13` dataset

As an example dataset we will be using `nycflights13` package, and the dataset `flights`.
It consists the 336,776 flights that departed from New York in 2013.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("nycflights13")
library(nycflights13)
flights
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(nycflights13)
flights
```

???

Check the help page for `flights` to see what the columns represent.

---

# dplyr basics

All dplyr verbs act on data frames, and this should be the first argument to all of these functions.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
dplyr_function(<data frame>, ...)
```

The `...` represents other arguments that the function might take, and these vary depending on the verb.

One very nice feature of dplyr is that we have access to all of the variables in the data frame that we are acting on.
This means that we don't have to specify the data frame in addition to the variable we are interested whenever we want to use a variables, but we can simply refer to it by the variable name (i.e. the column name; without quotes).

All dplyr verbs return a data frame.

???

Within the dplyr function call, all the variables in the data frame are available for us to use.
Outside the function call, we still have to refer to the variables by specifying the data frame and the variable within the data frame.

---

# Selecting rows with `filter`

Flights that were not delayed:

```{r, render = print_df_5}
filter(flights, dep_delay <= 0)
```

???

So, we tell the `filter` function that we want to work on the `flights` data frame, and then to return all rows that fulfill the criteria that we specify.
In this particular case, we say the the departure delay must be less than or equal to zero.
What this then does is to create a new data frame containing only the rows that meet this criterion.

---

# Selecting rows with `filter`

We can make more complex filters by setting up multiple criteria.

```{r, render = print_df_5}
filter(flights, dep_delay <= 0, origin == "JFK")
```

Adding more conditions separated by commas corresponds to AND-logic.
This is the same as writing

```{r, eval = FALSE}
filter(flights, dep_delay <= 0 & origin == "JFK")
```

---

# Selecting rows with `filter`

If we want to use boolean operators other than AND, we have to specify them manually.

```{r}
filter(flights, dest == "CPH" | dest == "ARN")
```

---

# Common errors with `filter`

.left-column[
## Missing variable
]

.right-column[
```{r, error = TRUE}
filter(flights, depdelay <= 0)
```
]

???

Here the problem is that the variable is not called `depdelay`, but `dep` *underscore* `delay`.
In this case it's a spelling error, but the result would be the same if you try to use any variable that is not in the data frame.

--

.right-column[
```{r, error = TRUE}
depdelay <- 10
filter(flights, depdelay <= 0)
```
]

???

This is a more subtle variant of the previous error.
Let's say that we have declared a variable `depdelay` *outside* of our data frame, and then try to access this in `filter`.
The result is and empty data frame.
Why?

---

# Common errors

.left-column[
## Missing variable
## Comparison typo
]

When making strict checks for equality, make sure to use `==`.

.right-column[
```{r, error = TRUE}
filter(flights, origin = "JFK")
```
]

At least dplyr gives you a nice error message in this case.

???

This is a mistake I do from time to time, probably due to how you normally specify function arguments with a single equals sign.

---

# Selecting columns with `select`

.left-column[
## Basics
]

.right-column[
We can subset a data frame to just the columns we are interested in with `select`.

```{r, render = print_df_5}
select(flights, origin, dest, dep_time)
```

This can be useful if we want to get a better overview of variables that we are interested in, or to save some resources if we're dealing with a very big dataset.
]

---

# Selecting columns with `select`

.left-column[
## Basics
## Ranges
]

.right-column[
We can also select a range of columns with the `:` operator.

```{r, render = print_df_5}
select(flights, year:dep_time)
```
]

---

# Selecting columns with `select`

.left-column[
## Basics
## Ranges
## Helper functions
### `starts_with`
]

.right-column[
```{r, render = print_df_5}
select(flights, starts_with("time"))
select(flights, starts_with(c("dep", "arr")))
```
]

---

# Selecting columns with `select`

.left-column[
## Basics
## Ranges
## Helper functions
### `starts_with`
### `ends_with`
]

.right-column[
```{r, render = print_df_5}
select(flights, ends_with("time"))
select(flights, ends_with(c("time", "delay")))
```
]

---

# Selecting columns with `select`

.left-column[
## Basics
## Ranges
## Helper functions
### `starts_with`
### `ends_with`
### `contains`
]

.right-column[
```{r, render = print_df_5}
select(flights, contains("st"))
```
]

---

# Selecting columns with `select`

.left-column[
## Basics
## Ranges
## Helper functions
### `starts_with`
### `ends_with`
### `contains`
### `matches`
]

.right-column[
All of the previous functions match strings literally.
`matches` is the most general of the bunch and can use [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) for matching column names.

```{r, render = print_df_5}
select(flights, matches("d.*ay"))
```
]

---

# Create new variables with `mutate`

.left-column[
## Basics
]

.right-column[
`mutate` will create new variables at the end of the dataset, so let's use `select` to get a better overview.

```{r, render = print_df_5}
flights_small <- select(flights, ends_with("delay"), distance, air_time)
mutate(flights_small,
       speed_mph = distance / (air_time / 60))
```
]

---

# Create new variables with `mutate`

.left-column[
## Basics
]

.right-column[
We can even refer to our new variables *within* the call to `mutate`.

```{r, render = print_df_5}
mutate(flights_small,
       gain = dep_delay - arr_delay,
       gain_per_hour = gain / (air_time / 60))
```
]

---

# Create new variables with `mutate`

.left-column[
## Basics
## Multiple columns
]

.right-column[
If we want to apply a function to several variables in our dataset, this is also possible using `across`.

```{r, render = print_df_5}
mutate(flights_small,
       speed = distance / (air_time / 60),
       across(.cols = c(distance, speed),
              .fns = ~ . / 1.609))
```
]

---

# Create new variables with `mutate`

.left-column[
## Basics
## Multiple columns
]

.right-column[
In the previous example, the original variables will be overwritten by the new ones we create.
If we don't want to replace them, we can set the names of the new columns using the `.names` argument (check `?across` for details).

```{r, render = print_df_5}
mutate(flights_small,
       speed = distance / (air_time / 60),
       across(.cols = c(distance, speed),
              .fns = ~ . / 1.609,
              .names = "{.col}_km"))
```
]

---

# Create summaries with `summarise`

.left-column[
## Basics
]

.right-column[
`summarise` boils down a dataframe to a single row.

```{r}
summarise(flights, arr_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Summarising like this is not that useful though.
]

---

# Create summaries with `summarise`

.left-column[
## Basics
## `group_by`
]

.right-column[
Creating summaries on grouped data frames is much more useful.
This can be accomplished with using `summarise` together with `group_by`.

```{r, render = print_df_5}
by_day <- group_by(flights, year, month, day)
summarise(by_day, arr_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```

In this example, we group by day, and then calculate the mean arrival delay for each day.
The result is a data frame with one row per day.

# Relational data

.left-column[
## Introduction
]

.right-column[

It is often the case that we have multiple datasets with one or several variables in common between them.
This is what we call **relational data**.

There are four tibbles in the nycflights13 package that can be connected to each other.

- `flights`: this we've already seen
- `airports`: airport metadata
- `planes`: airplane metadata
- `weather`: weather data for the New York airports

# Relational data

.left-column[
## Introduction
## Keys
]

.right-column[
The variables that determine what is a unique observation in each of these tibbles are called keys.
There are two types of keys.

### Primary keys

Keys that identify unique observations in the tibble where they occur, e.g. `faa` in the `aiports` tibble.
A primary key can be either a single variable, or a combination of variables.
They have to be unique; no two observations can have the same primary key.

### Foreign keys

Keys that link between tibbles, e.g. `origin` in `fligths` is a foreign key referring to `faa` in `airports`.
Foreign keys do not have to be unique, but they have to uniquely identify an observation in a different tibble.

A variable can be both a primary key, *and* a foreign key.
An example of this is `origin` which is part of the primary key in the `weather` tibble, but also a foreign key connecting it to `airports`.

## Joins
]

.right-column[
There are three different ways that we can join relational data:

- **Mutating joins**, which add variables from one tibble to another based on matching observations.
- **Filtering joins**, which filter observations in one tibble based on whether or not they match observations in another tibble.
- **Set operations**, which treats observations as set elements.

# Mutating joins

]

.right-column[
Let's say we want to add the name of the airline to the flights table.
In order to make the output a bit more readable, we create a new tibble with fewer variables.

```{r}
flights2 <- select(flights, year:day, hour, origin, dest, tailnum, carrier)
```

```{r}
left_join(flights2, airlines, by = "carrier")
```
]

# Mutating joins

.left-column[
## Introduction
## Types of joins
]

.right-column[
There are a couple of different ways that we can join tibbles:

- Inner join: `inner_join`; returns observations that are found in both tibbles.
- Outer join: `left_join`, `right_join`, `full_join`; returns observations that are found in either the first or the second tibble, or both.
- Full join: `full_join`; returns all observations from both tibbles.
]

.right-column[
```{r}
x <- tribble(
       ~key, ~val_x,
       1,    "x1",
       2,    "x2",
       3,    "x3",
)

y <- tribble(
       ~key, ~val_y,
       1,    "y1",
       2,    "y2",
       4,    "y3",
)
```

.pull-left[
```{r, echo = FALSE}
join_tbl <- function(x, ...) {
       kbl(x) %>%
              kable_classic(full_width = FALSE, ...) %>%
              column_spec(1, background = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(4, "Pastel1")[x$key]) %>%
              htmltools::div()
}
join_tbl(x)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = FALSE}
join_tbl(y)
```
]
]

???

This might be the first time that you see the `tribble` function.
It is similar to the `tibble` function, but is more suited for quick creation of small tibbles such as these.
The way the code is written more closely resembles the final tibble than if we would have done it with the `tibble` function.

.right-column[
Inner joins are the simplest type of join.
It will return the observations that are found in both of the tibbles.

So far the data has been very nice to us in that there has been no duplicated keys.
This is not always the case in real data, and sometimes duplicated keys are a necessity (e.g. foreign keys).

  ~key, ~x2_val,

.right-column[
Another case is when we have duplicate keys in both tibbles that we want to join.
Performing a join on these will result in all possible combinations of the duplicate keys being generated.
This might sometimes be the behaviour that we want, but usually it is due to an error since none of the keys uniquely identifies observations in either tibble.

# Filtering joins

.left-column[
## Introduction
]

.right-column[
Filtering joins have the same mechanics as the mutating joins, but instead of focusing on the variables in the data, they focus more on the observations.
There are two ways of performing filtering joins:

- `semi_join(x, y)`: returns all observations in `x` found in `y`.
- `anti_join(x, y)`: returns all observations in `x` *not* found in `y`.
]

---

# Filtering joins

.left-column[
## Introduction
## `semi_join`
]

.right-column[
`semi_join` returns all observations in `x` that are found in `y`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
semi_join(x, y, by = "key")
```

.held[
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hold"}
join_tbl(x)
htmltools::div(icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("arrows-alt-h"), scale = 4))

```{r, echo = FALSE}

x %>%
  semi_join(y, by = "key") %>%
  join_tbl()
```
]

???

So, you can see that the behaviour is similar to a left join, but here we don't keep the variables in `y`.

# Piping

.left-column[
## Until now
]

.right-column[
Up until now, we've been executing all these functions one by one, potentially saving the intermediate result into a new variable:

```{r}
hnl_flights_1 <- filter(flights, dest == "HNL")
hnl_flights_2 <- mutate(hnl_flights_1,
                        avg_speed = (distance * 1.61) / (air_time / 60))
hnl_flights_3 <- select(hnl_flights_2, tailnum, avg_speed)
hnl_flights_4 <- arrange(hnl_flights_3, desc(avg_speed))
hnl_flights_4
```
]

???

Let's say we want to find the speed of the fastest flight to Honolulu.

This is kind of tedious, and it is also very easy to get the numbers wrong at some point, potentially resulting in long debugging sessions.

---

# Piping

.left-column[
## Until now
## Nesting function calls
]

.right-column[
```{r}
arrange(
  select(
    mutate(
      filter(flights, dest == "HNL"),
      avg_speed = (distance * 1.61) / (air_time / 60)
    ),
    tailnum, avg_speed
  ),
  desc(avg_speed)
)
```
]

???

The downside of doing it this way is that it is hard to write, and to read.
The first function call is the innermost one, and the last function call to execute is the outermost one.

---

# Piping

.left-column[
## Until now
## Nesting function calls
## The pipe `%>%`
]

.right-column[
The pipe `%>%` is a function from the magrittr package, but it is imported by dplyr and available if you have loaded the dplyr package, or the tidyverse package.
It takes the result from the left side and passes that as the first variable to the function on the right side.

```{r}
mean(1:15)
1:15 %>% mean()
```
]

--

.right-column[
```{r}
1:15 %>% mean() %>% rep(4)
```
]

And we can continue with the pipe for as long as we like

--

.right-column[
```{r}
1:15 %>% mean() %>% rep(4) %>% length()
```
]

# Piping

.left-column[
## Until now
## Nesting function calls
## The pipe `%>%`
]

.right-column[
```{r}
filter(flights, dest == "HNL") %>%
  mutate(avg_speed = (distance * 1.61) / (air_time / 60)) %>%
  select(tailnum, avg_speed) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_speed))
```
]

???

- No intermediate variables
- Clear to read

# A visual example

```{r flights_map, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 13, fig.height = 8, fig.align = "center"}
usa_map <- map_data("world", "usa")
state_map <- map_data("state")
ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(data = state_map, mapping = aes(long, lat, group = group),
               fill = "white", colour = "black", lwd = 0.1) +
  geom_point(data = airports, mapping = aes(lon, lat), size = 0.5) +
  geom_curve(data = flights %>%
               inner_join(airports %>% select(origin = faa, o_lat = lat, o_lon = lon), by = "origin") %>% 
               inner_join(airports %>% select(dest = faa, d_lat = lat, d_lon = lon), by = "dest") %>% 
               group_by(origin, dest, o_lat, o_lon, d_lat, d_lon) %>% 
               count(),
             aes(x = o_lon, y = o_lat,
                 xend = d_lon, yend = d_lat,
                 alpha = n, size = n),
             angle = 90, curvature = 0.2,
             colour = "steelblue") +
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(0.1, 1)) +
  coord_quickmap(xlim = c(-125, -68), ylim = c(23, 50)) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        panel.border = element_blank(),
        panel.grid = element_blank(),
        axis.text = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        axis.title = element_blank())
```

Here I map the number of flights to both the stroke thickness and the stroke opacity.
This will make the more trafficked routes pop in the visualisation.
