Data in itself is just a collection of observations, and more often than not, they don't convey a message by itself.

# Data is not information

We can sort the data...

# Data is not information

```{r, echo = FALSE}
htmltools::div(htmltools::img(src = "../img/lego_visualisation_1.jpg", alt = "A pile of LEGO bricks in multiple colours.", class = "tile-item", style = "width: 35%;"),
               htmltools::img(src = "../img/lego_visualisation_2.jpg", alt = "A pile of LEGO bricks, sorted by colour", class = "tile-item", style = "width: 35%;"),

               class = "tile", style = "align-items: flex-end;")

And arrange the data...

               class = "tile", style = "align-items: flex-end;")
```

???

And finally visualise the data in a way that tells us something that the raw dataset did not.

---

# Data is not information

```{r, echo = FALSE}
htmltools::div(htmltools::img(src = "../img/lego_visualisation_1.jpg", alt = "A pile of LEGO bricks in multiple colours.", class = "tile-item", style = "width: 35%;"),
               htmltools::img(src = "../img/lego_visualisation_2.jpg", alt = "A pile of LEGO bricks, sorted by colour", class = "tile-item", style = "width: 35%;"),
               htmltools::img(src = "../img/lego_visualisation_3.jpg", alt = "LEGO bricks sorted by colour and arranged into piles.", class = "tile-item", style = "width: 35%;"),
               htmltools::img(src = "../img/lego_visualisation_4.jpg", alt = "LEGO bricks sorted by colour and arranged into neat bars, resembling a bar chart.", class = "tile-item", style = "width: 35%;"),
               htmltools::img(src = "../img/lego_visualisation_5.jpg", alt = "A LEGO house.", class = "tile-item", style = "width: 35%;"),
               class = "tile", style = "align-items: flex-end;")
```

???

Then we can also proceed to build a story out of our data.
How can our data help us convey a message?
Going from a bar chart to a story like this is really hard work, and not something that you just do.
This requires a lot of skill and insight, and is not something you learn over night.

This is perhaps the most famous example of data visualisation, all categories.

This is the work of Charles Joseph Minard.
It was created in 1869 and shows the losses suffered by Napoleon's army on their march on Russia in 1812.
The thick band illustrates the size of the army at different points during the march.
The brown band is the advancing part of the army, and the black lines are the retreating parts of the army.

This visualisation is famous for capturing many different types of data in a digestible format.
We have the size of the army, the direction they're heading, geographical position (including distance), time, and temperature.

He is considered the father of modern epidemiology.

In the cholera outbreak in London in 1854, he talked to local residents to get more information about the area.
Using this information, they were able to determine that the source of the outbreak was a water pump in the area.
Note that this was before the germ theory of disease had been developed, and the prevailing hypothesis at the time was that it was spread through air-borne particles, so called "miasma", or "bad air".

There is one exception in this neighbourhood, and that is the brewery.
None of the workers there contracted the disease, and this is likely due to them having their daily allowance of beer and thus didn't drink from the contaminated well.

This next example has a connection to the previous one.
Many of the cholera patients from Broad Street were treated at the Middlesex Hospital, where Florence Nightingale was the superintendent.
She was a lot of things; statistican, considered the founder of modern nursing, and also a pioneer in graphical visualisation of statistics.
She was also the main figure behind the sanitary reform, since she had noticed that many deaths could be prevented with improved sanitation.

This particular figure is perhaps her most famous one.
In 1854, she brought a team of nurses to care for British soldiers fighting in the Crimean War, and this figure visualises the causes of death for the soldiers they were treating.
Blue represents deaths from preventable infectious disease, red represents deaths from war wounds, and black represents deaths from other causes.
The diseases represented were typhus, typhoid, cholera, and dysentery.
The bars are not stacked, so the number of deaths are represented as the distance from the center of the plot.
From this we can clearly see that deaths from disease by far outnumber the number of deaths from war wounds.

Today, these plots are referred to as coxcomb charts, or Nigthingale roses.

# ggplot2

.pull-left[
An R package for creating graphics in a declarative fashion.

Based on the Grammar of Graphics, which we will talk more about next week.

Useful both for quickly visualising a dataset for exploratory purposes, but also produces publication-quality figures.

It is possible to create graphics using the base functionality of R, but this has a very steep learning curve, and requires a lot of fiddling.
This is something that we will not go over.

Add a layer of points to the plot.
The `aes` (aestethics) maps variables in our data to properties of the plot, and here we set the variable `displ` (engine displacement in litres) as our x-variable and `hwy` (miles per gallon on highway) as our y-variable.

```{r basic_plot_points2, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 4.5}

- Positions (`x`, `y`, ...)
- Outline colour (`colour`)

.right-column[
When mapping a variable to an aesthetic, ggplot2 takes care of everything else: setting an appropriate scale and sets up a legend.

Very flexible system for quickly visualising structure in your data. If a variable exists in your dataset, it can be mapped to an aesthetic.

What if a variable that you are interested in is not in the dataset?
We will get to ways of solving this next week.

Colours can also be specified using the `rgb` function, which generates a hexidecimal colour value.

```{r rgb}
rgb(0.8, 0.3, 0.1)

If you are fluent in hexadecimal, you can also specify colours directly as such.

```{r rgb_plot, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 4}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), colour = "#CC4D1A")

# Facets

.left-column[
## What are they?
]

.right-column[
Another way of mapping variable to aesthetics is by using facets.
This is based on the concept of ["small multiples"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_multiple): many panels of a figure that share scales and axes, allowing for easy comparison.

# Facets

.left-column[
## What are they?
## `facet_wrap`
]

.right-column[
When we have single categorical variable with many different values that we want to facet on, we generally use `facet_wrap`.
This will create one sub-plot for each level of the faceting variable.

```{r facet_example}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(class), nrow = 2) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

# Facets

## What are they?
## `facet_wrap`

.right-column[
Compare these two versions.
They are visualising the same relationship (engine size vs fuel efficiency), and they are grouped by the class of car.
The difference is that one uses facets, and the other uses colour.
Which one is easier to read?

# Facets

.left-column[
## What are they?
## `facet_wrap`
## `facet_grid`
]

.right-column[
If we instead have two categorical variables that should be faceted, we can use `facet_grid`.
One variable will then represent the rows and the other the columns.

```{r facet_grid_example}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(drv), cols = vars(cyl)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```
]

Here we have the `drv` variable, the type of drivetrain of the cars, as rows and the number of cylinders representing the columns.
Note that all facets have the same scales.

What do you think it means if a facet is empty?

# Geometric objects

???

So far we have talked about how we can map different variables to aesthetics in our plot, but we've only looked at scatter plots, i.e. points, so far.
What if we want to represent our data differently?

--

.pull-left[
.center[
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/data_visualisation_with_ggplot2_basic_plot-1.png", dpi = 192)
```
]
]

???

Consider this figure, that we now have seen a few times.

--

.pull-right[
.center[
```{r smooth_geom_example, echo = FALSE, fig.show = 'asis'}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```
]
]

???

And now consider this.
The underlying data and the variables on the axes are the same, but they look quite different.
The reason for this is that they are using different geoms.

.pull-left.center[
`geom_point`
]

.pull-right.center[
`geom_smooth`
]

# Geometric objects

.left-column[
## What are they?
]

.right-column[
The geometrical object that is used to represent the underlying data.

Every geom function takes a `mapping` argument, but the aesthetics that you can set vary between them.
For example, you can set the shape for `geom_point`, but that wouldn't make sense for `geom_line`.
]

--

.right-column[
Geoms roughly correspond to the type of plot we want to create:

- Scatter plot: `geom_point`
- Line plot: `geom_line`
- Histogram: `geom_histogram`
- Boxplot: `geom_boxplot`
]

--

.right-column[
The [ggplot2 cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) is a great way of getting an overview of the over 40 geoms that are available.

# Geometric objects

.left-column[
## What are they?
## Aesthetics
]

.right-column[
Many geoms, such as `geom_smooth`, uses a single geometric object to visualise multiple observations.
Setting an aesthetic such as linetype for `geom_smooth` to a categorical variable will create a geometric object for each level of that variable.

```{r geom_smooth_aes, fig.show = "hold", out.width = "50%"}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, linetype = drv))

ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = drv))
```
]

---

# Geometric objects

.left-column[
## What are they?
## Aesthetics
## Grouping
]

.right-column[
An aesthetic that can be useful for these types of geoms is `group`.
This will group observations according to a categorical variable, but not change any other aesthetic for those groups, and it will thus not create a legend either.

```{r geom_grouping, fig.show = "hold", out.width = "50%"}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, linetype = drv))

ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, group = drv))
```

# Statistical transformations

.left-column[
## The bar chart
]

.right-column[
Here we introduce a new dataset: `diamonds`.
This contains data on more than 50,000 diamonds.

Here we create a bar chart of the diamond cut qualities.
Notice how we only specify the `x` aesthetic, but still we have a y-axis our figure.
How come?

```{r bar_chart}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut))
```
]

---

# Statistical transformations

.left-column[
## The bar chart
## `stat_count`
]

.right-column[
By default, `geom_bar` uses a statistical transformation in order to produce the variables needed for the plot.

.held.smaller[
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'hold'}
mpg %>%
  group_by(manufacturer) %>%
  slice_head(n = 2) %>%
  head(10) %>% 
  select(manufacturer) %>% 
  knitr::kable()

htmltools::div(icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("long-arrow-alt-right"), scale = 3))

mpg %>%
  group_by(manufacturer) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  head() %>%
  knitr::kable()

htmltools::div(icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("long-arrow-alt-right"), scale = 3))

htmltools::div(htmltools::img(src = "figures/data_visualisation_with_ggplot2_bar_chart-1.png"))
```
]
]

# Statistical transformations

.left-column[
## The bar chart
## `stat_count`
## Default stats
]

.right-column[
All geoms perform some type of statistical transformation (`stat`) of the data before plotting it.
For a scatter plot, the transformation function simply returns the values that are supplied.

All geoms have a default `stat`, and all statistical transformations have a default `geom`:

- `geom_point`: `stat_identity`
- `geom_smooth`: `stat_smooth`
- `geom_histogram`: `stat_bin`
- `geom_boxplot`: `stat_boxplot`
- `geom_bar`: `stat_count`

.note.yellow[
`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("lightbulb"))`
Again, check the help to see what the default `stat` is for a geom, e.g. `?geom_bar`.

# Positions

.left-column[
## The bar chart again
]

.right-column[
When mapping the fill aesthetic for a bar chart to variable different from the x variable, the chart will by default be stacked.

```{r stacked_bar_chart}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity))
```
]

---

# Positions

.left-column[
## The bar chart again
## The position argument
]

.right-column[
We can change this behaviour by modifying the `position` parameter.
Looking at the help page for `geom_bar`, we see that the default is `"stacked"`.
Other possible values for bar charts are `"identity"`, `"dodge"`, and `"fill"`.
]

# Positions

.right-column[
```{r bar_chart_position_identity}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity),
           position = "identity")
```

.note.yellow[
`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("lightbulb"), scale = 2)`
Note that the position argument goes *outside* of `aes`.
It is an argument to the geom, not to the mapping.
]
]

           position = "dodge")

# Positions

.left-column[
## The bar chart again
## The position argument
### `"identity"`
### `"dodge"`
### `"fill"`
### `"jitter`"
]

.right-column[
A position adjustment that doesn't work for bar charts, but can be useful for scatter plots, is `"jitter"`.
Let's take a look at our previous scatter plot using the `mpg` data.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/data_visualisation_with_ggplot2_basic_plot_points2-1.png")
```
]

???

If you are really observant, you will see that there are 126 points in this figure...

--

.right-column.small[
```{r}
mpg
```
]

???

while there are 234 observations in the data.

This is something that is referred to as overplotting: several observations having the same value.
The problem with this is that we from this figure can't tell how these are distributed.
Is one combination of values more common than others, or are they evenly spread out?

---

# Positions

.left-column[
## The bar chart again
## The position argument
### `"identity"`
### `"dodge"`
### `"fill"`
### `"jitter`"
]

.right-column[
Adding jitter to the plot will add some noise to each point, and this will help avoid overplotting.
A consequence of this, however, is that the points then don't exactly represent the underlying data.

```{r geom_point_jitter}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy),
             position = "jitter")
```
]

???

While being inaccurate at small scales, it really improves the bigger picture.

---

# Positions

.left-column[
## The bar chart again
## The position argument
### `"identity"`
### `"dodge"`
### `"fill"`
### `"jitter`"
]

.right-column[
Jitter thus works best when applied to categorical variables.

```{r geom_point_jitter_categorical}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = factor(cyl), y = hwy),
             position = position_jitter(height = 0, width = 0.25))
```
]

???

Here we only apply jitter in the horizontal direction, thus only affecting the categorical variable on the x-axis.
The values on the y-axis are still accurately represented, but there is no confusion where the points belong on the x axis.
