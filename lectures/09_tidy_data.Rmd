# Data representation

The same data can be represented in many different ways.

---

# `table1`

```{r}
table1
```

???

This dataset shows the population of three countries together with the number of cases of tuberculosis.

---

# `table2`

```{r}
table2
```

---

# `table3`

```{r}
table3
```

---

# `table4`

```{r}
table4a
table4b
```

This example differs from the others in that it has been separated into two datasets; one for population size and one for the number of cases.

---

# What is tidy data?

- Each variable must have its own column
- Each observation must have its own row
- Each value must have its own cell

![](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6f1ddb544fc5c69a2478e444ab8112fb0eea23f8/91adc/images/tidy-1.png)

???

Now we will go over the datasets that we just looked at and see if they fulfill these criteria.

---

# `table1`

```{r}
table1
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
check_circle <- icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("check-circle", style = "solid"), fill = "forestgreen")
times_circle <- icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("times-circle", style = "solid"), fill = "#DC222B")
```


--

`r check_circle` Each variable must have its own column

--

`r check_circle` Each observation must have its own row

--

`r check_circle` Each value must have its own cell

---

# `table2`

```{r}
table2
```

--

`r times_circle` Each variable must have its own column

--

`r times_circle` Each observation must have its own row

--

`r check_circle` Each value must have its own cell

---

# `table3`

```{r}
table3
```

--

`r times_circle` Each variable must have its own column

--

`r check_circle` Each observation must have its own row

--

`r times_circle` Each value must have its own cell

---

# `table4`

```{r}
table4a
table4b
```

--

`r times_circle` Each variable must have its own column

--

`r times_circle` Each observation must have its own row

--

`r times_circle` Each value must have its own cell

# How to make a dataset tidy

In practice:

- Put each dataset in a tibble
- Put each variable in a column

However, depending on the dataset, it might not be obvious what is an observation or a variable.
Often it is possible to deduce from the dataset, but sometimes you will have to contact the person responsible for collecting the data in order to be sure.

.right-column[
Typically, this would be something like an Excel spreadsheet with some of the following problems:

- Nested variables
- Variables encoded as something other than text/numbers, e.g. colours or grouping of data

These things might not only make it difficult to manipulate the data in R, but even difficult to properly load into R in the first place.
Problems related to spreadsheets are quite common, and unfortunately there is no one solution that fits all here.

Here I will talk about a couple of problems that we have to fix before we can even load the data into R.
It is either that information will be lost by loading the data, or that it will make the loading process more complicated than necessary.

One thing that I have seen more than once is that important variables are encoded as colours in a spreadsheet.
This is something that works well when entering and viewing data, but not so much when processing the data.

Another common way of representing what should really be a variable is by grouping data in smaller tables, similar to table 4 that I showed before, in different spreadsheets, or even in the same spreadsheet.

# When to make a dataset tidy

.left-column[
## Before loading into R

### tidyr
]

.right-column[
The tidyr package contains a number of functions that can help us tidy up our datasets.
tidyr is a core member of the tidyverse, so by loading tidyverse you will also have access to tidyr.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

We will go through the following functions:

- `pivot_longer`
- `pivot_wider`
- `separate`
- `unite`
]

---

# When to make a dataset tidy

.left-column[
## Before loading into R
## After loading into R
### tidyr
]

.right-column[
Two of the most common issues related to untidy data that you will face are:

1. Variables spread across multiple columns.
2. Observations spread across multiple rows.

To solve these problems, we can use two functions in the tidyr package: `pivot_longer` and `pivot_wider`.
]

# When to make a dataset tidy

.left-column[
## Before loading into R
## After loading into R
### tidyr
### `pivot_longer`
]

.right-column[
```{r, echo = FALSE}
wide_data <- tribble(
  ~gene,  ~treatment1, ~treatment2, ~wt,
  "gene1", 2,           2,           4,
  "gene2", 1,           1,           1,
  "gene3", 3,           5,           5
)
```

```{r}
wide_data
```

This is a case where we have variables that are spread across multiple columns.
The columns `treatment1`, `treatment2` and `wt` are actually all values of `condition`, and the values of these should be values of `expression`.

`pivot_longer` takes a tibble and makes it longer than the original tibble by creating a pair of variables from a number of existing columns.
You need three things:

1. The columns that whose names should be a variable
2. The name of the new variable to put the column names in.
3. The name of the new variable to put the values in.

.right-column[
```{r}
pivot_longer(wide_data,
             c(treatment1, treatment2, wt),
             names_to = "condition",
             values_to = "expression")
```
]

???

The columns to pivot are specified with `dplyr::select()` style notation.

# When to make a dataset tidy

.left-column[
## Before loading into R
## After loading into R
### tidyr
### `pivot_longer`
### `pivot_wider`
]

.right-column[
```{r, echo = FALSE}
long_data <- tribble(
  ~gene, ~condition, ~type, ~value,
  "gene1", "treatment1", "expression", 2,
  "gene1", "treatment1", "accessibility", 22,
  "gene1", "treatment2", "expression", 2,
  "gene1", "treatment2", "accessibility", 30,
  "gene1", "wt", "expression", 4,
  "gene1", "wt", "accessibility", 50,
  "gene2", "treatment1", "expression", 1,
  "gene2", "treatment1", "accessibility", 15,
  "gene2", "treatment2", "expression", 1,
  "gene2", "treatment2", "accessibility", 12,
  "gene2", "wt", "expression", 1,
  "gene2", "wt", "accessibility", 18
)
```

```{r}
long_data
```

In this data, each combination of `gene` and `condition` is an observation.
The `type` only represents two different variables (`expression` and `accessibility`) from the same observation.
In other words, we have to make this dataset wider by making the values in the `type` column into variables.

# When to make a dataset tidy

.left-column[
## Before loading into R
## After loading into R
### tidyr
### `pivot_longer`
### `pivot_wider`
]

.right-column[
`pivot_wider` can accomplish this, and it needs two things:

1. The column that contains the names of the new variables.
2. The column that contains the values of those new variables.

```{r}
pivot_wider(long_data, names_from = type, values_from = value)
```
]

.left-column[
## Before loading into R

### tidyr
### `pivot_longer`
### `pivot_wider`
### `separate`
]

.right-column[
Sometimes multiple variables are represented as a single variable.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
united_data <- tibble(
  gene = c("gene1", "gene1", "gene1", "gene2", "gene2",  "gene2", "gene3", "gene3", "gene3"),
  condition = c("treatment1", "treatment2", "wt", "treatment1", "treatment2", "wt", "treatment1", "treatment2", "wt"),
  expression = c(2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 5)
) %>% 
  unite(gene_condition, gene, condition)
```

```{r}
united_data
```
]

# When to make a dataset tidy

.left-column[
## Before loading into R
## After loading into R
### tidyr
### `pivot_longer`
### `pivot_wider`
### `separate`
]

.right-column[
tidyr has a function called `separate` that takes a character column, splits it and creates two **separate** columns.
It needs two things:

1. The column that should be separated.
2. The names of the new variables to create.

```{r}
separate(united_data, col = gene_condition,
         into = c("gene", "condition"))
```
]

---

# When to make a dataset tidy

.left-column[
## Before loading into R
## After loading into R
### tidyr
### `pivot_longer`
### `pivot_wider`
### `separate`
]

.right-column[
By default, `separate` will split the column on any non-alphanumeric character.
In this particular example, this was fine since the two variables were separated by an underscore.
You can also explicitly state how they should be separated with `sep`:

```{r}
separate(united_data, col = gene_condition,
         into = c("gene", "condition"),
         sep = "_")
```
]

---

# When to make a dataset tidy

.left-column[
## Before loading into R
## After loading into R
### tidyr
### `pivot_longer`
### `pivot_wider`
### `separate`
### `unite`
]

.right-column[
There are also cases when we have the opposite situation from what we just went over, that you have a variable that is split across multiple columns.
This can be corrected by uniting the columns with `unite`.

```{r}
table5
```
]

---

# When to make a dataset tidy

.left-column[
## Before loading into R
## After loading into R
### tidyr
### `pivot_longer`
### `pivot_wider`
### `separate`
### `unite`
]

.right-column[
`unite` needs two things:

1. The name of the new column.
2. The columns that should be united.

```{r}
unite(table5, "year", century, year)
```

Here we see that the default is to separate the original values with an underscore.
This might be appropriate in some cases, but here it is not.

# When to make a dataset tidy

.left-column[
## Before loading into R
## After loading into R
### tidyr
### `pivot_longer`
### `pivot_wider`
### `separate`
### `unite`
]

.right-column[
Analogously to `separate`, we can specify how the values should be joined in `unite` with `sep`:

```{r}
unite(table5, "year", century, year, sep = "")
```
]
