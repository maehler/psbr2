# What is a function?

> In computer programming, a subroutine is a sequence of program instructions that performs a specific task, packaged as a unit.
> This unit can then be used in programs wherever that particular task should be performed.

We've used a lot of functions throughout the course, but let's take a closer look at how functions work.

---

# Defining a function

We can define a function like this

```{r}
my_add <- function(x, y) {
  x + y
}
```

This particular function is called `my_add` which takes two arguments: `x` and `y`.
The last line of the function body will be the return value of the function.
In this case in will return the sum of `x` and `y`.

```{r}
my_add(5, 7)
my_add(-3, 2)
my_add(1, NA)
```

.right-column[
We can split a function into three parts

1. Arguments
2. Body
3. Environment

Furthermore, just as vectors are objects in R, functions are also objects.

.right-column[
We can access function arguments using the `formals` function

```{r}
formals(my_add)
```

The function body can be accessed with the `body` function

```{r}
body(my_add)
```
]

---

.right-column[
Finally, we can get the environment of the function with `environment`.

```{r}
environment(my_add)
```
]

---

# A breakdown

.left-column[
## Fundamentals
## Function components
## Primitive functions
]

An exception when it comes to these function components are **primitive functions**.
These are defined in the C programming language, and these functions have been compiled to machine code.

```{r}
sum
`[`
```

???

The reason for having functions in C can either be that the function is very tightly integrated into the R language, and R is written in C.
Another reason is for optimisation purposes.

These functions only exist in the base package.
While they generally have better performance, they are harder to write, so the R development team tries to avoid writing functions like this as far as possible.

Functions are like any other object in R, and they are defined like any other object, unlike many other languages.

.pull-left[
R:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
my_add <- function(x, y) {
  x + y
}
```


Python:
```{python, eval = FALSE, python.reticulate = FALSE}
def my_add(x, y):
  return x + y
```

Javascript:
```{r javascript, eval = FALSE}
function my_add(x, y) {
  return(x + y);
}
```
]

.pull-right[
C:
```{c, eval = FALSE}
int my_add(int x, int y) {
  return(x + y);
}
```

Rust:
```{rust, eval = FALSE}
fn my_add(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {
  x + y
}
```

PHP:
```{php, eval = FALSE}
function my_add($x, $y) {
  return $x + $y;
}
```
]
]

.right-column[
While we normally want to name our functions, we have seen cases where it's not worth naming them.
These function are called **anonymous functions**.

```{r}
mpg %>%
  group_by(manufacturer, model) %>%
  summarise(across(c(cyl, trans, class), function(.) length(unique(.))))
```
]

The purrr package has a short-hand way of declaring anonymous functions.

```{r, results = FALSE}
mpg %>%
  group_by(manufacturer, model) %>%
  summarise(across(c(cyl, trans, class), ~ length(unique(.))))
```

purrr is a package with tools for functional programming in R.
I will talk more about this package and functional programming later in the course.

# Function composition

This is a topic we have treated quite a bit, but without really putting words on it.
In base R we have two ways of combining functions in order to get them to perform a task for us.
Let's say we define a couple of functions for calculating the standard deviation
$$
\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N{(x_i - \overline{\mu})^2}}{N}}
$$

```{r}
square <- function(x) x^2
deviation <- function(x) x - mean(x)
```

---

# Function composition

.pull-left[

```{r}
x <- runif(100)
sqrt(mean(square(deviation(x))))
```

```{r}
out <- deviation(x)
out <- square(out)
out <- mean(out)
out <- sqrt(out)
out
```

```{r}
deviation(x) %>% 
  square() %>% 
  mean() %>% 
  sqrt()
```
]

.pull-right[
$$\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N{(x_i - \overline{\mu})^2}}{N}}$$
All these are equivalent, but they all have their strengths and weaknesses.

The first one is concise, especially for shorter expressions, but we have to read it from the inside out.

The second one is good if we want to make use of intermediate values, but bad if we are not interested in it.
Also not the best if we are running code interactively since it will be hard knowing what state `out` is in.

The last one reads well, and in the "right" order, but it is limited to a linear workflow on a single object.
This is also the only one of these that requires an external package, and also for the reader to be familiar with the concept.

# Lexical scoping

What does this function return?

```{r}
x <- 10
foo <- function() {
  x <- 20
  x
}
```

--

```{r}
foo()
```

--

The reason for this is the way that R looks up values.
For functions this is determined how the function is defined, not how it is called.
This is called **lexical scoping**.

???

Next we will go through some rules for how this works.

---

# Lexical scoping

.left-column[
## Name masking
]

.right-column[
Names inside a function mask names defined outside the function.

```{r}
x <- 5
y <- 7
my_add <- function() {
  x <- 1
  y <- 2
  x + y
}
```
]

???

What do you think this function will return based on this information?

--

.right-column[
```{r}
my_add()
```
]

---

# Lexical scoping

.left-column[
## Name masking
]

.right-column[
If a name is not defined inside the function, it looks one level further up.

```{r}
x <- 5
y <- 7
my_add <- function() {
  x <- 1
  x + y
}
```
]

--

.right-column[
```{r}
my_add()
```
]

???

What will this return?

--

.right-column[
```{r}
y
```
]

???

And the value of `y` is unchanged.
This `y` only exists in the function environment.

---

# Lexical scoping

.left-column[
## Name masking
## Functions vs variables
]

.right-column[
Since functions in R are objects, the same scoping rules apply to functions.

```{r}
foo <- function(x) x + 100
bar <- function() {
  foo <- function(x) x + 1
  foo(10)
}
```
]

--

.right-column[
```{r}
bar()
```
]

---

# Lexical scoping

.left-column[
## Name masking
## Functions vs variables
]

.right-column[
If a function and a non-function have the same name, then if we try to use that name in a function call, R will ignore non-function objects.

```{r}
foo <- function(x) x + 100
bar <- function() {
  foo <- 10
  foo(foo)
}
```
]

.right-column[
```{r}
bar()
```
]

--

.right-column[
`r note("It goes without saying that using the same name for different things is confusing, at best.", "warning")`
]

---

# Lexical scoping

.left-column[
## Name masking
## Functions vs variables
## A fresh start
]

.right-column[
Whenever a function is called, a new environment is created for it.

```{r}
foo <- function() {
  if (!exists("z")) {
    z <- 1
  } else {
    z <- z + 1
  }
  z
}
```
]

???

What happens when we call this function the first time?

--

.right-column[
```{r}
foo()
```
]

???

What happens if we call it a second time?

--

.right-column[
```{r}
foo()
```
]

---

# Lexical scoping

.left-column[
## Name masking
## Functions vs variables
## A fresh start
## Dynamical lookup
]

.right-column[
R won't try to look for a value until the function is run.

```{r}
add_one <- function() x + 1
x <- 15
add_one()

x <- 20
add_one()
```

We can check what a function will try to access outside of it.

```{r}
codetools::findGlobals(add_one)
```
]

???

This can be very frustrating if we have typos in our code.
We won't get an error message when we write the function, since it's determined when we run it.
It might even be that we don't get errors when we run the function, depending on our environment.

There are ways of checking things like this.

Even though this might seem like an annoying feature, the reason why it's there also is what makes R simple in this sense: it uses this type of lexical scoping to find *everything*.
It doesn't matter if it's trying to find the `mean` function, or the `+` operator or the variable you just defined.
It all works the same.

---

# Lazy evaluation

Another thing with how variables are used by functions is that they are evaluated lazily.
This means that the value of the variable is not checked until it is used.

```{r}
foo <- function(x) {
  5
}

foo(stop("error"))
```

--

```{r}
foo <- function(x, y = message("this is an expensive operation")) {
  x + 5
}

foo(3)
```

???

This means that we can set default arguments in functions that can be expensive to calculate, but they won't be evaluated unless they are actually used.

---

# Default arguments

Not only can we do computation in our default arguments, but we can also access variables defined *inside* the function itself.

.pull-left[
```{r}
foo <- function(x, y = z + 5) {
  z <- x + 2
  x + y
}

foo(5)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
foo <- function(x = ls()) {
  a <- 5
  c(x, a)
}

foo()
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
foo(ls())
```

```
## [1] "foo"
```
]

---

# dot-dot-dot

You have likely seen the `...` argument for many functions that you have used.

```{r}
args(select)
```

What this does is to take any other, named, arguments.
These are often used to pass arguments to other functions.

.pull-left[
```{r}
foo <- function(...) {
  list(...)
}

foo(one = 1, two = 2)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
get_summary <- function(x, fun = mean, ...) {
  fun(x, ...)
}

get_summary(c(1:5, NA))
get_summary(c(1:5, NA), na.rm = TRUE)
```
]

---

# Exiting a function

.left-column[
## Return
]

.right-column[
We have used return values up until now, but not really talked about them.
These have all been **implicit returns**: the last expression that gets evaluated is returned.

```{r}
foo <- function(x) {
  x
  x + 5
}
foo(2)
```

We can also do an **explicit return** by using the `return` function.

```{r}
foo <- function(x) {
  return(x)
  x + 5
}
foo(2)
```
]

---

# Exiting a function

.left-column[
## Return
## Error
]

.right-column[
If for some reason we encounter something that we cannot recover from, we can issue an error.

```{r, error = TRUE}
foo <- function() {
  stop("an error occured")
  return(5)
}
foo()
```
]

.right-column[
```{r, error = TRUE}
foo <- function(x) {
  stopifnot(x > 5)
  x
}
foo(3)
foo(6)
```
]
