# Expected learning outcomes

--

> 1. Understand how to appropriately enter and store primary and meta data from a range of experiment types including field, greenhouse and molecular biology assay scale datasets.

--

> 2. Produce new and utilise existing R scripts and use help resources to apply R functions.

--

> 3. Demonstrate understanding of how to perform an visualise quality control checks of a range of data types including data structure, technical reproducibility and biological variance.

--

> 4. Produce appropriate figures that demonstrate understanding of the difficulties, and solutions for, visualisation of large-scale data.

--

> 5. Be able to apply statistical tests to test hypotheses.

--

> 6. Justify the selection of analysis and visualisation methods.

# Examination

The examination consists of three parts, all of which will be submitted individually. You are however allowed, and encouraged, to discuss the issues you run into among yourselves.

--

## Practical assignment 1

Will treat topics from the two first weeks of the course, and will take place on October 11.

--

## Practical assignment 2

Will treat the second part of the course, and will take place on October 27-29.

--

## Short-answer knowledge test

A theoretical exam that will take place on November 1.

---

# Practical assignment 1

Will be made available on the morning of October 11.

- Tidying of a messy dataset
- Data manipulation using dplyr
- Plotting

The submission will close at 23:59 on October 11.

---

# Practical assignment 2

Will be made available on the morning of October 27.
This task will be a bit more extensive compared to the first assignment.

- Use of R Markdown
- Load a bigger dataset into R.
- Data quality control, including visualisation.
- Statistical analysis.

The submission will close at 23:59 on October 29.

# How to hand in the practical assignments

- Upload all files related to the assignment in Canvas.
- One of the files should be a Word document where you can outline the whole assignment, answer assignment questions, and refer to other files that you have uploaded.
- Name that you upload ***clearly***.


- [How to install Office 365 on your computer](https://manual.its.umu.se/en/how-do-i-download-and-install-office365/)
- [Office 365 Online](http://o365.umu.se) (you'll be asked to log in with your CAS ID)

# Grading

.left-column[
## Practical assignments
]

.right-column[
Each of the two assignments and the will be graded U, G, or VG.

- **G**: You have tried to solve the task at hand, and your approach is sensible. The results do not necessarily have to be 100% correct. If graphics are part of the answer, they should be clearly labelled. If source code is part of the solution, the code should preferably run without issues. If there are issues you know about, then these should be mentioned either in the accompanying document, or as comments in the source code.
- **VG**: You have shown a good understanding of the task, and the approach is sensible. The results closely resemble what is described in the task. If graphics are part of the answer, they should be clearly labelled, have clear legends whenever appropriate, and the aesthetics of the graphics should follow best practices. If source code is part of the solution, the code should run without major issues, be properly formatted, have clear variable names, and be commented where appropriate.

???

Don't worry if you don't understand what all of these criteria mean right now: we will get to those eventually in the course.

In the lectures I will refer to a lot more material, but I will try to collect all of these in a single place as we go.
If I forget, then please remind me.
