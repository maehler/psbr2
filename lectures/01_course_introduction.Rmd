# Expected learning outcomes

--

> 1. Understand how to appropriately enter and store primary and meta data from a range of experiment types including field, greenhouse and molecular biology assay scale datasets.

--

> 2. Produce new and utilise existing R scripts and use help resources to apply R functions.

--

> 3. Demonstrate understanding of how to perform an visualise quality control checks of a range of data types including data structure, technical reproducibility and biological variance.

--

> 4. Produce appropriate figures that demonstrate understanding of the difficulties, and solutions for, visualisation of large-scale data.

--

> 5. Be able to apply statistical tests to test hypotheses.

--

> 6. Justify the selection of analysis and visualisation methods.
