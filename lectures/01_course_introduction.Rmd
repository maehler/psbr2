# Expected learning outcomes

--

> 1. Understand how to appropriately enter and store primary and meta data from a range of experiment types including field, greenhouse and molecular biology assay scale datasets.

--

> 2. Produce new and utilise existing R scripts and use help resources to apply R functions.

--

> 3. Demonstrate understanding of how to perform an visualise quality control checks of a range of data types including data structure, technical reproducibility and biological variance.

--

> 4. Produce appropriate figures that demonstrate understanding of the difficulties, and solutions for, visualisation of large-scale data.

--

> 5. Be able to apply statistical tests to test hypotheses.

--

> 6. Justify the selection of analysis and visualisation methods.

# Examination

The examination consists of three parts, all of which will be performed individually.

--

## Practical assignment 1

Will treat topics from the two first weeks of the course, and will take place on October 11.

--

## Practical assignment 2

Will treat the second part of the course, and will take place on October 27-29.

--

## Short-answer knowledge test

A theoretical exam that will take place on November 1.

---

# Practical assignment 1

Will be made available on the morning of October 11.

- Tidying of a messy dataset
- Data manipulation using dplyr
- Plotting

The submission will close at 23:59 on October 11.

---

# Practical assignment 2

Will be made available on the morning of October 27.
This task will be a bit more extensive compared to the first assignment.

- Use of R Markdown
- Load a bigger dataset into R.
- Data quality control, including visualisation.
- Statistical analysis.

The submission will close at 23:59 on October 29.

# How to hand in the practical assignments

Due to limitations in Canvas, I recommend that the assignments are handed in by:

- Submitting a link to an Office365/Google document that contains all answers. This document could also link to other documents (e.g. spreadsheets, HTML files, or R scripts).
- Documents that don't fit well into a Word document can be uploaded to OneDrive (also in Office365) and be linked to from the main document.

[Office 365 at Umeå University](http://o365.umu.se) (you'll be asked to log in with your CAS ID)

???

As students at Umeå University, you all have access to Office 365, and this is the solution that I will recommend.
